When you see instructions like:

bash
Copy
Edit
# On Linux/Mac
export TOGETHER_AI_KEY=your_api_key_here

# On Windows
set TOGETHER_AI_KEY=your_api_key_here
it means:

âœ… You are setting an environment variable called TOGETHER_AI_KEY on your operating system (Linux/Mac/Windows).
âœ… This environment variable stores your API key temporarily in your computer's memory so that your applications/scripts can access it securely, without hardcoding the key directly into your code.

Why Do We Use Environment Variables for API Keys?
Security: You should not write API keys directly into your code (e.g., api_key = "123abc") because it can be exposed if your code is shared or uploaded (like to GitHub).

Separation of Configuration from Code: Environment variables keep secrets/configurations separate from your codebase.

Flexibility: You can easily change keys without editing code â€” just change the environment variable.

Best Practice: Professional applications, servers, and cloud platforms use environment variables for sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and API keys.

Detailed Meaning of the Commands:
1. For Linux or Mac (bash shell)
bash
Copy
Edit
export TOGETHER_AI_KEY=your_api_key_here
export makes the variable TOGETHER_AI_KEY available to all child processes (any program you run after setting it).

your_api_key_here is where you put your actual API key.

ðŸ”µ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
export TOGETHER_AI_KEY=AbC1234YourRealAPIKey
Now if you run a Python script, Node.js app, or any other program, it can access TOGETHER_AI_KEY from the environment.

2. For Windows (Command Prompt)
bash
Copy
Edit
set TOGETHER_AI_KEY=your_api_key_here
set is the Windows equivalent command.

Same idea: it temporarily saves the API key in the environment.

ðŸ”µ Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
set TOGETHER_AI_KEY=AbC1234YourRealAPIKey
Important: In Windows PowerShell, the command is a bit different. It would be:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:TOGETHER_AI_KEY="your_api_key_here"
How You Access the Environment Variable in Code:
Depending on your programming language, you read the environment variable like this:

Python:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
api_key = os.getenv('TOGETHER_AI_KEY')
Node.js (JavaScript):

javascript
Copy
Edit
const apiKey = process.env.TOGETHER_AI_KEY;
Bash Script:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo $TOGETHER_AI_KEY
Additional Notes:
Temporary: When you set the environment variable in a terminal, it only lasts for that session. If you close the terminal, itâ€™s gone.

Permanent Setting: If you want it permanently set (so you don't set it every time), you must add it to your profile file:

Linux/Mac: Add the export ... line to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zshrc file.

Windows: You can add environment variables permanently via System Properties â†’ Environment Variables.
