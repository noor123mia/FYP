Since you're using Anaconda, the best and cleanest way to use Python 3.8 or higher is by creating a new environment instead of changing your system Python. Itâ€™s safe and easy.

âœ… Step-by-Step Python 3.10 Anaconda Environment Setup
Open Anaconda Prompt (not regular CMD).

Create a new environment with Python 3.10

conda create -n jobmatchenv python=3.10
jobmatchenv is the name of your new environment.

python=3.10 will ensure it installs Python 3.10.

Activate the environment

conda activate jobmatchenv
Go to your project folder


cd CUsersPMYLSDesktopFYPjob-matching-api
Install the required packages


pip install -r requirements.txt
Thatâ€™s it! Your API project will now run in Python 3.10 with all compatible packages. ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ’¡ To Use This Environment Later
Every time you want to work on your project

Open Anaconda Prompt

Run

conda activate jobmatchenv








C:\Users\PMYLS\Desktop\FYP\temp\job-candidate-matching


uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860 --reload
